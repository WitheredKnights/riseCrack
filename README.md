## What is RiseClient ?
Rise Client is a cheat client for 1.8.9 Minecraft which is very popular and is dominant on Hypixel.

Rise Client is paid and ofc we can't be having that because in the words of Linus Torvalds
```
Software is like sex, its best when its free.

```
Damm thats a dope ass quote

**Note For TLauncher**: I heard TLauncher dosn't require the addition of the `-noverify` arguement so just don't add it. If it dosn't work add it.
